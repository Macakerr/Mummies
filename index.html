            <h2>I. How to Make a Mummy</h2>
            <p>Ancient Egyptians didn't make mummies to be scary. They did it because they loved life! They believed that if you preserved your body, your spirit (called the <strong>Ka</strong>) could live forever in a paradise called the "Field of Reeds."</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: The Salt Bath</h3>
                    <p>To stop the body from decaying, priests used a special salt called <strong>Natron</strong>. It’s like a mix of baking soda and salt. They covered the body in it for 40 days to dry it out, kind of like making beef jerky!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Step 2: The Wrapping</h3>
                    <p>Next, they wrapped the body in linen bandages. This wasn't random—it was an art! They placed <strong>Amulets</strong> (good luck charms) inside the layers to protect the person from bad spirits on their journey.</p>
